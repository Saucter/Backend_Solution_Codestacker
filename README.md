# Introduction
Welcome to my project! My name is Mohammed Al-Hosni, 17, and at the time of writing a student at RGOTC.
This repo is a proposed solution for Rihal's backend developement challenge. A part of their Codestacker 2023 contest.

> Here is a [Notion file](https://traveling-flame-6a3.notion.site/PDF-API-codestacker-challenge-306ee59ee3be419b9b339fd80a53c1ea
) showcasing the notes written during the preperation phase for the challenge: 


# Running instructions
### GitHub or zip file installation
* Prerequisite: Dotnet SDK 7.0 or later
* `Git install`: Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/Saucter/Backend_Solution_Codestacker.git`
* `Zip file install`: Simply download and unzip the file to a given directory 
* Launch the cloned repository / Unzipped file on your choice of Text Editor or IDE
* Launch a new terminal session
* Run `cd ./PDF_Reader_APIs/Server` (Use backward slashes for Windows)
* Run `dotnet run` 
* Click the link in the terminal while holding the `Cntrl` or `âŒ˜` key for Windows/Linux or MacOS respectively
* The API can then be tested using Postman or Insomnia using the shown API URIs

# API URIs
### Basic authentication usernames and passwords (No whitespaces)
* Username: Mohammed | PW: DoesThisWork123?
* Username: RihalTeam | PW: Your_PW:)
* FOR DELETE APIs -> Username: ForDeleteOnly | PW: PlsDoNotUse101

### POST URI(s)
**PostPDF:** http://localhost:5143/pdf/PostPDF

Allows the user to post a PDF to the database
* Param 1: `form-data Files`: A form-date parameter for PDF submission / upload
* Param 2: `bool WithTxtFile`: If true inputs the parsed sentences into a .txt file and uploads it to object storage. False by default and can be disabled to improve speed
* Param 3: `bool WithImages`: If true runs OCR over the images of the PDF. Used for Image-based PDFs. False by default, can be disabled to improve speed

### GET URI(s)
**GetPDFs:** http://localhost:5143/pdf/GetPDFs

Allows the user to retireve a PDF and its information based on the PDF's ID
* Param 1: `List<int>? id`: A list of IDs for the API to retrieve from the DB. Retrieves all PDFs if the list is null
* Param 2: `bool WithSentences`: If true it returns the PDFs with the parsed sentences. False by default, turned off to minimize screen clutter on retrieved JSON if unnecessary

**GetKeyword:** http://localhost:5143/pdf/GetKeyword

Allows the user to retrieve the sentences in which a given keyword resides in as well the number of times the word has occurred
* Param 1: `List<int>? id`: Allows the user to decide which PDF(s) to look in. Looks at all PDFs if the list is null
* Param 2: `string Keyword`: the keyword that the API should look for
* Param 3: `bool Exact`: If true it makes sure the matched results are exactly like the submitted keyword (i.e. 'and' in 'mandate' is not considered). False by default
* Param 4: `bool CaseSensitive`: If true it makes sure the matched results follow the same case as the submitted keyword. False by default

**GetTopWords:** http://localhost:5143/pdf/GetTopWords

Gets the top 'x' words in a list of PDFs while filtering out any stop-words
* Param 1: `List<int>? id`: A list of PDF IDs that the API should look for top words in. Checks the top words in all PDFs if the list is null
* Param 2: `int? NumberOfWords`: Allows the user to the top 'x' words to retrieve. If param is null the default the top 5 words. 
* Param 3: `List<string>? Ignore`: Allows the user to remove certain words from the retrieved list

### DELETE URI(s)
**DeletePDF:** http://localhost:5143/pdf/DeletePDF

Alllows the user to delete an PDF from the DB based on ID. Requires header authentication
* Param 1: `List<int>? id`: A list of PDF IDs that the API should delete from the DB

**DeleteAll:** http://localhost:5143/pdf/DeleteAll

Alllows the user to delete all PDFs found in the DB. Requires special header authentication
* No parameters
